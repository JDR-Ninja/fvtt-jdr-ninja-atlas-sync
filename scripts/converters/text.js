/**
 * Bounded free text, shared by the converters. The Atlas server caps every text field in UTF-16
 * code units (`string.Length`), so the cut is a `slice(0, max)` and never a code-point count. Two
 * traps follow from cutting a string that way, both handled here:
 *  - a cut that lands right after a space keeps a trailing space that the server trims before it
 *    compares names (`name.Trim()`, OrdinalIgnoreCase), so two cut names differing only by that
 *    space would collide server-side and the whole sheet be refused: trim again after the cut;
 *  - a cut that lands between the two halves of a surrogate pair leaves a lone high surrogate,
 *    which JSON.stringify writes as `\udXXX` and the server refuses as invalid JSON: drop it.
